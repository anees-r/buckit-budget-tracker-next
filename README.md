Buckit - Your Budget and Finance Tracker

Buckit was developed using following tech stack,
- NextJs (Full-Stack)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- ShadCn UI (Sleek Components)
- ZOD (Validation)
- Prisma (ORM)
- SQLite (Development)
- PostgreSQL (Production)

This project was created to expand my skill set and learn full stack development in NextJs. It was my first experience using Prisma, Zod & ShadCn. This project was made following a youtube tutorial by "Kliton Bare" - https://youtu.be/nANLXwxZxks

If you want to use the source code, you are free to do so but please mention me and Kliton Bare. Thanks!

The env file contains 
- Variables from Clerk Auth. (Make your account there and add provided variables by Clerk)
- Variables from Prisma for your Database which is PostgreSQL here.

If you just want to run it on LocalHost, then clone the repo from previous commit.

Have fun!
